This is a questionnaire to find out what you would like to see in
Thursday's lab session. We plan to offer in parallel to the lab
session two short talks about:

\smallskip
\hspace*{1cm} Making a \textsf{GAP} package

\hspace*{1cm} \textsf{GAP}'s types, operations and method selection

\smallskip
This is about what you would like to see in addition to these two.

For the Thursday lab session I would like to
(multiple answers possible)
