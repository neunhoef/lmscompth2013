I found the worksheets for the lab sessions:
  "with the right range of difficulties"

Remark: I have only done one worksheet so far and have been working
on my own problems more.

For Thursday: Get an introduction on how to use GAP for *basic*
computations.

For Thursday: ask questions about problems occured in past research
using GAP and discuss this in group (GAP discussion forum)
And: Increasing the interactivity might be helpful to understand
better the power and limits of GAP, and to see in which areas, for
which purposes GAP can be used (and IS used)

Algorithms for cohomology of polycyclic groups would be very welcome.

I think that the labs are the best way they can be, given the range of
past usage of GAP we have here.

But this was my first time working with/seeing GAP.

I would like to: "Ask a question about a particular problem I'm
working on. (Requires presenting it on a white board - but only takes
2 minutes to describe.)"

The worksheets have been: "a good introduction"

For Thursday: "data structures, how HAP talks to PARI"
