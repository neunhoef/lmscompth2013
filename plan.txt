4. Finitely Presented Groups (Max Neunhoeffer, University of St Andrews)

This lecture course will start to discuss the word problem for finitely
presented groups, discussing the impossibility of solving it with
an algorithm. It then covers the following fundamental algorithms:
Todd/Coxeter, Low Index, Abelian Invariants and Reidemeister-Schreier.
A brief excursion into Small Cancellation Theory will then motivate
rewrite systems, present Dehnâ€™s Algorithm and lead to the Knuth-Bendix
procedure. Time permitting, the course will cover automatic groups.



Lecture 1:
Introduction to FP groups (universal property)
The fundamental problems one would like to solve
Insolvability of the word problem
Changing presentation: Tietze Transformations
  -> GAP example
Abelianisation and abelian invariants
  -> GAP example

Lecture 2:
equivalence of finite index subgroups and finite perm reps
Coset enumeration:
  idea (fix the subgroup, determine index)
  an example very slowly
  theorem about successful outcome
  different strategies
  theorem about completion
  real world example in GAP
Low index
  idea (fix an upper bound for the index, determine subgroups)
  an example very slowly
  theorem about successful outcome
  conjugacy of subgroups
  real world example in GAP

Lecture 3:
Presentations of subgroups (Reidemeister-Schreier)
  -> GAP example
Proving FP groups to be infinite
  -> GAP example
Rewrite systems: termination, confluence
Knuth-Bendix procedure
  -> GAP example

Lecture 4:
Hyperbolic groups
Small Cancellation conditions: Dehn's algorithm
  -> GAP example
Automatic Groups: Definition
  -> KBMAG example

    --> Tietze transformations
    (3 min)
  * Describe GAP's approach to presentations and Tietze
    (1 min)

  * Recognise G/G' as H := <X|R and commutators>
    (2 min)
