4. Finitely Presented Groups (Max Neunhoeffer, University of St Andrews)

This lecture course will start to discuss the word problem for finitely
presented groups, discussing the impossibility of solving it with
an algorithm. It then covers the following fundamental algorithms:
Todd/Coxeter, Low Index, Abelian Invariants and Reidemeister-Schreier.
A brief excursion into Small Cancellation Theory will then motivate
rewrite systems, present Dehnâ€™s Algorithm and lead to the Knuth-Bendix
procedure. Time permitting, the course will cover automatic groups.
